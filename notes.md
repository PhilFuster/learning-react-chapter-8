Really struggled with managing state and getting my RepoMenu component to render when a login was changed. The other components were loading just fine.
I basically just reread the last couple of sections and tried to follow all instructions along the way.
I spent a lot of time trying to draw the mental model in my head of passing state around.
I think I learned a lot from reading the code over and over again trying to reason about why it wouldn't work.
I think maybe next time I'll commit the errors. That way when I solve it. I can look back at the original broken code.
Now I don't know what exactly fixed it. It was probably human error like a spelling mistake or something.
